  <p>Hi! my name is Mandi H.<br></p>

  <p>I am currently a junior film student at Huntington University. 
    I really enjoy editing and the post production aspect of film. 
    You tell a story after the story was filmed. 
    I hope to eventually become a freelance editor where I can work remotely and travel the world.      <br></p>

  

  <p>Outside of school, I enjoy working on and taking pictures of cars. 
    My <strong>favorite</strong> event to go to is anything <a href="https://driftindy.com">Drift        Indy</a>. Drifting is a passion I have had in me for a really long time, but I never did anything with that want until college. I also love going to autocross events with my boyfriend, because I always make a new connection and friend every time I go. Autocross is basically the extreme baby version of drifting, where you try to go around cones without hitting them. Think of horse barrel racing, but without the horses and instead with cars!<br></p>
